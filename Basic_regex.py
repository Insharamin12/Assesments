#The check_web_address function checks if the text passed qualifies as a top-level web address,
#meaning that it contains alphanumeric characters (which includes letters, numbers, and underscores),
#as well as periods, dashes, and a plus sign,
#followed by a period and a character-only top-level domain such as ".com", ".info", ".edu", etc.
#Fill in the regular expression to do that, using escape characters, wildcards, repetition qualifiers, beginning and end-of-line characters, and character classes.

import re
def check_web_address(text):
  pattern = r"^(www\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}$"
  result = re.search(pattern, text)
  return result != None

print(check_web_address("gmail.com")) # True
print(check_web_address("www@google")) # False
print(check_web_address("www.Coursera.org")) # True
print(check_web_address("web-address.com/homepage")) # False
print(check_web_address("My_Favorite-Blog.US")) # True

#Question 2
#The check_time function checks for the time format of a 12-hour clock,
#as follows: the hour is between 1 and 12, with no leading zero, followed by a colon,
#then minutes between 00 and 59, then an optional space, and then AM or PM, in upper or lower case.
#Fill in the regular expression to do that. How many of the concepts that you just learned can you use here?
